      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I’m a computing science student who is learning to code and has an interest in finding solutions for challenging problems. The 2 main skill sets
        I follow and practice are:
        <li type="1">Ability to be Self Sufficient</li>
        <li type="1">Ability to Troubleshoot</li>
      <p>These 2 skills I find are very useful and helpful for beginner computing science students who want to develop their skills and be distinguishable
        from others.

      <p>I was born and raised in New Westminster, BC. My background is part Turkish (Father's Side) and Indian (Mother's Side). Both my parents are multilingual,
        but unfortunately, I'm only bilingual. My favourite food is Kibbeh, it's a very popular dish in the Middle East!
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>In my free time, I try to go out for daily 1 km runs to stay in shape and be healthy. A few hikes throughout Summer and from time to time, Soccer
        whenever I get all my friends together. It's all about time management, but even sometimes I can't do everything I want to.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>What I'm currently learning:</p>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>C#</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the near future, I’d like to learn more about...</p>
      <ul class="skills-2">
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Advanced JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>My end goal is to learn as much as I can at Douglas College regarding Computer Science and continue to learn after graduation and even after landing
        a career. There's no limit on your ability to learn and grow.</p>
      <p>I would like to go down the path of Cloud Computing, which interests me the most as it's an
        extremely popular and rapidly growing industry. I have taught myself some of the concepts and technologies used but there is still more to learn.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Other than goals regarding school and work, I have set some financial goals for myself in the future. Even if it's saving a little each month, but investing wisely for the long 
        term. I believe it's always great to start ahead because the habits and actions of today will reflect and show a few years down the road.
